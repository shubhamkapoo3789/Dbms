    GROUP BY SID
    HAVING COUNT(RollNo) > 5
);
```

ORDER BY DOB DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**10. Find the most popular society (based on enrollments).**
```sql
SELECT SocName

    LIMIT 1
);
```

**11. Find the two least popular societies.**
```sql
SELECT SocName

    LIMIT 2
);
```

FROM STUDENT
WHERE RollNo IN (
    SELECT RollNo
    FROM ENROLLMENT
    GROUP BY RollNo
    HAVING COUNT(SID) >= 2
);
```

**14. Find society names with maximum students enrolled.**
```sql
SELECT SocName
FROM SOCIETY
WHERE SocID = (
    SELECT SID
    FROM ENROLLMENT

    LIMIT 1
);
```

**15. Find names of all students enrolled and corresponding society names.**

SELECT StudentName, SocName
FROM STUDENT S
JOIN ENROLLMENT E ON S.RollNo = E.RollNo
JOIN SOCIETY SO ON E.SID = SO.SocID;
```

```sql
SELECT StudentName
FROM STUDENT
WHERE RollNo IN (
    SELECT RollNo
